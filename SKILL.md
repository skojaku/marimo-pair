# marimo Pair Programming Protocol

You can interact with a running marimo notebook via **bundled scripts** or
**MCP**. Bundled scripts are the default — they work everywhere with no extra
setup. The workflow is identical either way; only the execution method differs.

## Prerequisites

The marimo server must be running with token and skew protection disabled.

### How to invoke marimo

Use the first matching strategy:

| # | Condition | Command | `--sandbox`? |
|---|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Project exists** — `pyproject.toml` in cwd or parent | `uv run marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection` | No (project manages deps) |
| 2 | **No project, `uv` available** | `uvx marimo@latest edit notebook.py --sandbox --no-token --no-skew-protection` | Yes (default) |
| 3 | **No project, no `uv`** — `marimo` on PATH | `marimo edit notebook.py --sandbox --no-token --no-skew-protection` | Yes (default) |

**Detection steps:**
1. Check for `pyproject.toml` in cwd or parents → strategy 1
2. Otherwise check `command -v uv` → strategy 2
3. Otherwise check `command -v marimo` → strategy 3
4. If none found, tell the user to install `uv` or `marimo`

**`--sandbox` is the default when there's no project.** Sandbox mode manages
dependencies in an isolated environment via PEP 723 inline metadata. Only skip
`--sandbox` when inside a project (strategy 1) or when the user explicitly
asks to skip it.

**No python file yet?** If the user asks to create a notebook but doesn't
name one, pick a descriptive filename based on context (e.g., `exploration.py`,
`analysis.py`, `dashboard.py`). Don't ask — just pick something reasonable.

**Do NOT use `--headless` unless the user asks for it.** Omitting it lets
marimo auto-open the browser, which is the expected pairing experience. If the
user explicitly requests headless, offer to open it with
`open http://localhost:<port>`.

If no servers are found, offer to start marimo as a background task. Be
eager — suggest it proactively. The user may also prefer to start it themselves.

**Always discover servers before starting a new one.** Background task
"completed" notifications do not mean the server died — check the output
or run discover before starting another.

## How to Discover Servers and Execute Code

Two operations: **discover servers** and **execute code**.

| Operation | Script | MCP |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Discover servers | `bash scripts/discover-servers.sh` | `list_sessions()` tool |
| Execute code | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh -c "code"` | `execute_code(code=..., session_id=...)` tool |
| Execute code (complex) | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh /tmp/code.py` | same |

Scripts auto-discover sessions from the registry on disk. Use `--port` to
target a specific server when multiple are running. If the server was started
with `--mcp`, you'll have MCP tools available as an alternative.

**Use a file for complex code.** When code contains quotes, backticks,
`${}` template literals, or multiline strings (common with anywidget ESM
modules), write the code to a temp file with the Write tool first, then pass
the file path as a positional argument. This avoids shell escaping issues
entirely.

**Inline ESM in cell code.** Temp files are for `execute-code.sh` transport
only — never for runtime. Use `"""` for ESM inside `'''` for the cell code.

## First Step: Explore the code_mode Context

The `code_mode` API can change between marimo versions. Your **first
execute-code call** should discover what the running server actually provides:

**Never guess method signatures.** Always `help(ctx.method_name)` before
calling a method for the first time — parameter names and defaults change
across versions.

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    print(dir(ctx))
    help(ctx)
```

## Two Modes of Working

**Scratchpad** (inspection only): Read state — `print(df.head())`, check data
shapes, explore the API with `dir()`/`help()`. Cell variables are already in
scope. Results come back to you — the user doesn't see them. You can also
read and set UI element state programmatically (see
[ui-state](reference/execute-code.md#ui-state)).

**Cell operations** (the main workflow): Creating, editing, moving, deleting
cells. Work directly in cells — the compile-check catches structural issues,
and runtime errors can be fixed in-place.

## Decision Tree

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Need to find running servers | Discover servers |
| Need to read data/state | Use scratchpad recipes in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md) |
| Need to create/edit/move/delete cells | Follow the cell-first workflow below, then use [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#cell-operations--mutating-the-notebook) |
| Need to install a package | Use the `code_mode` context — see [Installing Packages](#installing-packages) |
| Unsure what API to use | See **Discovering the API** in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#discovering-the-api) |
| Import path fails | See **Discovering the API** in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#discovering-the-api) |
| Package installed but module says it's missing | See [gotchas.md](reference/gotchas.md) — cached module proxies |
| Need a custom visualization or interactive widget | See [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md) (`_display_()` for display-only, anywidget for bidirectional) |
| Widget trait should drive downstream cells | `mo.state()` + `.observe()` — see [Reactive anywidgets](reference/rich-representations.md#reactive-anywidgets-in-marimo) |
| Need to display a notification to the user (toast, banner, focus) | See [other operations](reference/execute-code.md#other-operations) |
| User asks to improve/optimize/clean up the notebook | See [notebook-improvements.md](reference/notebook-improvements.md) |

## Cell-First Workflow

**Work directly in cells.** Create or edit cells in the notebook rather than
testing in the scratchpad first. The `async with` context manager
auto-compile-checks on exit — syntax errors, multiply-defined names, and
cycles are caught before any graph mutation occurs. If the check fails, the
operation is rejected and you get an error.

If a cell has a runtime error after creation, fix it in-place with
`ctx.edit_cell()`. This is faster than scratchpad round-trips and the user
sees progress incrementally.

**Reserve the scratchpad for inspection only** — reading data shapes, checking
variable state, exploring the API with `dir()`/`help()`. Don't use it to
pre-test code that's going into a cell.

### Steps (same for add or edit)

1. If editing, **read** the current cell code from the graph
2. **Create or update the cell** directly — the context manager
   auto-compile-checks. If it fails, fix the code and retry. See
   [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#cell-operations--mutating-the-notebook).
3. If there's a runtime error, **edit the cell** to fix it.

Keep cells small and focused — prefer splitting computation across cells and
extracting helpers over large monolithic cells. Hide code by default so the
notebook reads as a clean document. Don't bother naming cells while working —
names are optional and easier to add later when reviewing the notebook.

## Philosophy

You have full access to the running notebook. When the user's intent is clear,
act on it. When it's ambiguous, clarify.

Before reaching for external tools or CLIs, explore what `ctx` and marimo
already provide — marimo has integrations for many common operations (e.g.,
installing packages). Use `dir(ctx)` and `help()` to discover capabilities.

Before making choices, look for signal — notebook imports, `pyproject.toml`,
`sys.modules`, existing cells, directory structure. Follow existing patterns.
Take agency over things you're confident in. If you're not sure, ask.

## Guard Rails

Skip these and the UI breaks:

- **Install packages via `ctx.install_packages()`, not `uv add` or `pip`.**
  The code API handles kernel restarts and dependency resolution correctly.
  Only fall back to external CLIs if the API is unavailable or fails.
- **Custom widget = anywidget.** When the user asks for a "custom widget",
  "custom view", or any bespoke visual component, build an anywidget with
  HTML/CSS/JS — do NOT compose `mo.ui` elements. Composed `mo.ui` is fine
  for simple forms and controls, but anywidget gives full layout control,
  avoids same-cell value constraints, and is what the user expects when they
  say "custom". See [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md).
- Notify the frontend before executing cell operations — use `_code_mode`.
- The `async with` context manager auto-compile-checks — if it rejects, fix and retry.
- Clean up dry-run registrations — scratchpad side effects persist in the graph.
- Don't write to the `.py` file directly — the kernel owns it.
- **No temp-file deps in cells.** `pathlib.Path("/tmp/...")` in cell code is a bug.
- **No empty cells.** Before creating a cell, check for existing empty cells
  and `edit_cell` into them instead. On startup, use the default empty cell
  rather than appending. Clean up any cells that end up empty after edits.
- **Don't worry about cell names.** Names are not required for cells and are
  hard to come up with while working. Skip them by default — it's easier
  to add meaningful names later when reviewing the notebook as a whole.

Confirm with the user before:

- **Installing packages** — adds dependencies to their project.
- **Deleting cells** — removes work that may not be recoverable.
