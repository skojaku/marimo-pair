# marimo Pair Programming Protocol

You can interact with a running marimo notebook via **bundled scripts** or
**MCP**. Bundled scripts are the default — they work everywhere with no extra
setup. The workflow is identical either way; only the execution method differs.

## Prerequisites

The marimo server must be running with token and skew protection disabled:

```bash
marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection
```

Figure out the best way to invoke `marimo` from the current directory —
if it's a project with a managed environment, use that (e.g., `uv run marimo`).

**Do NOT use `--headless` unless the user asks for it.** Omitting it lets
marimo auto-open the browser, which is the expected pairing experience. If the
user explicitly requests headless, offer to open it with
`open http://localhost:<port>`.

If no servers are found, offer to start marimo as a background task. Be
eager — suggest it proactively. The user may also prefer to start it themselves.

**Always discover servers before starting a new one.** Background task
"completed" notifications do not mean the server died — check the output
or run discover before starting another.

## How to Discover Servers and Execute Code

Two operations: **discover servers** and **execute code**.

| Operation | Script | MCP |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Discover servers | `bash scripts/discover-servers.sh` | `list_sessions()` tool |
| Execute code | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh -c "code"` | `execute_code(code=..., session_id=...)` tool |
| Execute code (complex) | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh /tmp/code.py` | same |

Scripts auto-discover sessions from the registry on disk. Use `--port` to
target a specific server when multiple are running. If the server was started
with `--mcp`, you'll have MCP tools available as an alternative.

**Use a file for complex code.** When code contains quotes, backticks,
`${}` template literals, or multiline strings (common with anywidget ESM
modules), write the code to a temp file with the Write tool first, then pass
the file path as a positional argument. This avoids shell escaping issues
entirely.

**Inline ESM in cell code.** Temp files are for `execute-code.sh` transport
only — never for runtime. Use `"""` for ESM inside `'''` for the cell code.

## First Step: Explore the code_mode Context

The `code_mode` API can change between marimo versions. Your **first
execute-code call** should discover what the running server actually provides:

**Never guess method signatures.** Always `help(ctx.method_name)` before
calling a method for the first time — parameter names and defaults change
across versions.

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    print(dir(ctx))
    help(ctx)
```

## Two Modes of Working

**Scratchpad** (simple): Just Python — `print(df.head())`, check data shapes,
test a snippet. Cell variables are already in scope. Results come back to
you — the user doesn't see them. You can also read and set UI element state
programmatically (see [ui-state](reference/execute-code.md#ui-state)). The
kernel preamble in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md) has the correct
entry point and imports.

**Cell operations** (complex): Creating, editing, moving, deleting cells.
These require careful API orchestration — compile, register, notify the
frontend, then execute. Get it wrong and the UI desyncs.

## Decision Tree

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Need to find running servers | Discover servers |
| Need to read data/state | Use scratchpad recipes in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md) |
| Need to create/edit/move/delete cells | Follow the scratchpad-to-cell workflow below, then use [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#cell-operations--mutating-the-notebook) |
| Need to install a package | Use the `code_mode` context — see [Installing Packages](#installing-packages) |
| Unsure what API to use | See **Discovering the API** in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#discovering-the-api) |
| Import path fails | See **Discovering the API** in [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#discovering-the-api) |
| Need a custom visualization or interactive widget | See [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md) (`_display_()` for display-only, anywidget for bidirectional) |
| Widget trait should drive downstream cells | `mo.state()` + `.observe()` — see [Reactive anywidgets](reference/rich-representations.md#reactive-anywidgets-in-marimo) |
| Need to display a notification to the user (toast, banner, focus) | See [other operations](reference/execute-code.md#other-operations) |
| User asks to improve/optimize/clean up the notebook | See [notebook-improvements.md](reference/notebook-improvements.md) |

## The Scratchpad-to-Cell Workflow

**The cardinal rule: never show the user broken code.** Runtime errors in cells
are a bad experience. Runtime errors in the scratchpad are invisible learning.

**Compile-check is not validation.** It catches syntax errors, broken refs, and
cycles — but not wrong arguments, missing methods, or type mismatches. Don't
let a passing compile-check give you false confidence.

**ALWAYS test in the scratchpad before creating or editing a cell.** No
exceptions unless the user explicitly says to skip testing. If the code is
expensive, test on a subset — or if that's not possible, ask the user.

The `async with` context manager automatically compile-checks on exit —
syntax errors, multiply-defined names, and cycles are caught before any graph
mutation occurs. If the check fails, the operation is rejected and you get an
error. You don't need to compile-check manually.

If testing passes, do the cell operation immediately — in the same execute-code
call when possible. Never pause to ask; the only reason to pause is ambiguous
intent.

### Steps (same for add or edit)

1. If editing, **read** the current cell code from the graph
2. **Test in scratchpad** — run the code to validate at runtime
3. **Create or update the cell** — the context manager auto-compile-checks.
   If it fails, fix the code and retry. See
   [execute-code.md](reference/execute-code.md#cell-operations--mutating-the-notebook).

Keep cells small and focused — prefer splitting computation across cells and
extracting helpers over large monolithic cells. Hide code by default so the
notebook reads as a clean document.

## Philosophy

You have full access to the running notebook. When the user's intent is clear,
act on it. When it's ambiguous, clarify.

Before reaching for external tools or CLIs, explore what `ctx` and marimo
already provide — marimo has integrations for many common operations (e.g.,
installing packages). Use `dir(ctx)` and `help()` to discover capabilities.

Before making choices, look for signal — notebook imports, `pyproject.toml`,
`sys.modules`, existing cells, directory structure. Follow existing patterns.
Take agency over things you're confident in. If you're not sure, ask.

## Guard Rails

Skip these and the UI breaks:

- **Install packages via `ctx.install_packages()`, not `uv add` or `pip`.**
  The code API handles kernel restarts and dependency resolution correctly.
  Only fall back to external CLIs if the API is unavailable or fails.
- **Custom widget = anywidget.** When the user asks for a "custom widget",
  "custom view", or any bespoke visual component, build an anywidget with
  HTML/CSS/JS — do NOT compose `mo.ui` elements. Composed `mo.ui` is fine
  for simple forms and controls, but anywidget gives full layout control,
  avoids same-cell value constraints, and is what the user expects when they
  say "custom". See [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md).
- Notify the frontend before executing cell operations — use `_code_mode`.
- The `async with` context manager auto-compile-checks — if it rejects, fix and retry.
- Clean up dry-run registrations — scratchpad side effects persist in the graph.
- Don't write to the `.py` file directly — the kernel owns it.
- **No temp-file deps in cells.** `pathlib.Path("/tmp/...")` in cell code is a bug.
- **No empty cells.** Before creating a cell, check for existing empty cells
  and `edit_cell` into them instead. On startup, use the default empty cell
  rather than appending. Clean up any cells that end up empty after edits.

Confirm with the user before:

- **Installing packages** — adds dependencies to their project.
- **Deleting cells** — removes work that may not be recoverable.
