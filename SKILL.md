  Collaboration protocol for pairing with a user through a running marimo

  or modify a marimo notebook — or when you detect a running marimo session
  via `marimo session list`. Do NOT use for general Python scripting
  outside of marimo or for marimo plugin/package development.

# marimo Pair Programming Protocol

You can interact with a running marimo notebook via the **CLI** or **MCP**.
Prefer the CLI — it works everywhere with no extra setup. The workflow is
identical either way; only the execution method differs.

## CLI vs MCP

There are two operations: listing sessions and executing code. Use whichever
interface is available, preferring CLI.

| Operation | CLI | MCP |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| List sessions | `marimo session list --json` | `list_sessions()` tool |
| Execute code | `marimo session exec -c "code"` | `execute_code(code=..., session_id=...)` tool |

### CLI details

```bash
# Auto-discovers the session if only one is running
marimo session exec -c "print('hello')"

# Target a specific server by port
marimo session exec --port 2718 -c "print('hello')"

# Target a specific session on a server
marimo session exec --id <session-id> -c "print('hello')"
```

### MCP details

If the marimo server was started with `--mcp`, you'll have `list_sessions`
and `execute_code` tools available. Use them the same way — the recipes in
this skill show CLI commands, but substitute the MCP tool call equivalents.

## Two Modes of Working

`marimo session exec -c` is your only way to interact with the notebook. It
serves two distinct purposes:

**Scratchpad** (simple): Just Python — `print(df.head())`, check data shapes,
test a snippet. The notebook's cell variables are already in scope. Results
come back to you — the user doesn't see them. Use this freely.

Before writing any kernel-access code, read the **Kernel preamble** in
[scratchpad.md](reference/scratchpad.md) for the correct entry point and imports.

**Cell operations** (complex): Creating, editing, moving, deleting cells.
These require careful API orchestration — compile, register, notify the
frontend, then execute. Get it wrong and the UI desyncs.

## Decision Tree

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Need to find running sessions | `marimo session list --json` |
| Need to read data/state | Use recipes in [scratchpad.md](reference/scratchpad.md) via `marimo session exec -c` |
| Need to create/edit/move/delete cells | Follow the scratchpad-to-cell workflow below, then use [cell-operations.md](reference/cell-operations.md) |
| Unsure what API to use | See **Discovering the API** in [kernel-api.md](reference/kernel-api.md) |
| Import path fails | See **Discovering the API** in [kernel-api.md](reference/kernel-api.md) |
| Want a full walkthrough | Read [worked-example.md](reference/worked-example.md) |

## The Scratchpad-to-Cell Workflow

Before adding or editing a cell, always validate in the scratchpad first.
Compiling and graph-checking are cheap — always do them. Running code catches
real bugs before the user sees them.

### Adding a new cell

1. **Write** your code as a string
2. **Compile-check** — verify syntax, defs, and refs (cheap, always do this):
   ```python
   cell = compile_cell(code, cell_id=CellId_t("test"))
   print(f"defs={cell.defs}, refs={cell.refs}")
   ```
   See `compile-check` in [scratchpad.md](reference/scratchpad.md) for full recipe.
3. **Test in scratchpad** — run the code via `marimo session exec -c` to confirm it works. If it's expensive (network request, large query), test on a subset (smaller input, LIMIT clause, fewer params)
4. **If the code contains a network request or query**: consider asking the user before creating the cell, since execution will happen again when the cell runs. Or structure as two cells (fetch + transform) so the fetch only runs once
5. **Create the cell** — follow `create-cell` in [cell-operations.md](reference/cell-operations.md)

### Editing an existing cell

1. **Read** the current cell code from the graph
2. **Write** the modified code as a string
3. **Compile-check** — verify the edit doesn't break defs/refs or create cycles
4. **Test in scratchpad** — run the modified code to confirm it works
5. **Update the cell** — follow `edit-cell` in [cell-operations.md](reference/cell-operations.md)

## Philosophy

**You are a collaborator, not a code generator.** You're sitting next to someone
at their desk. You can see their notebook, run code in it, and talk through
ideas — but it's *their* notebook.

1. **The notebook is the artifact.** Build it *with* the user, not *for* them.
2. **User steers, you navigate.** They're the domain expert. You handle code.
3. **Balance visibility.** For a clear, specific ask — just do it. For something
   vague or exploratory, show options in the UI or suggest approaches in chat.

## App vs Analysis Mode

Ask early — this shapes how you build cells.

- **Analysis mode** (default): linear flow, code-forward, markdown narration,
  intermediate results visible. Reads like a report.
- **App mode**: UI elements (`mo.ui.*`), hidden code, layouts (`mo.hstack` /
  `mo.vstack`). The notebook is an interactive tool.

## Guard Rails

NEVER: Reload, restart, shutdown, or save the notebook — these are user-only.

NEVER: Write to the notebook `.py` file — no `Edit`, `Write`, `sed`, or any
file-modification tool. The kernel owns the file; writing behind its back will
desync state. You MAY read it (via `Read`, `Grep`, etc.) to understand existing
code and structure.

NEVER: Install packages without confirming with the user first.

NEVER: Delete user cells without confirmation.

NEVER: Create more than one cell at a time without asking.

NEVER: Modify existing user code without proposing the change first.

IMPORTANT: When creating or updating a cell, notify the frontend BEFORE
executing. See the `create-cell` and `edit-cell` recipes.

IMPORTANT: Always format cell code with ruff after writing. See `format-cell`
in [cell-operations.md](reference/cell-operations.md).

IMPORTANT: The scratchpad shares the kernel's namespace — side effects persist.
Clean up dry-run registrations (`graph.delete_cell`) to avoid phantom cells.

IMPORTANT: `code_is_stale=True` means the frontend shows code but the kernel
hasn't run it — use this for drafts the user should review before execution.
