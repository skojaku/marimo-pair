# Finding and Invoking marimo

marimo must be invoked with these flags to be discoverable by this skill:

```sh
marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection [--sandbox]
```

How you invoke `marimo` depends on context — find the right way to run it.

## Inside a Python project

If there's a `pyproject.toml` in cwd or a parent directory, check that marimo
is actually in the dependencies before using the project's runner. Look for
`marimo` in:

- `[project.dependencies]`
- `[project.optional-dependencies]` or `[dependency-groups]` (dev deps)
- `[tool.pixi.dependencies]`
- The project's `.venv` (`uv pip show marimo` or check `.venv/bin/marimo`)

If marimo is in a named dependency group (not the default), you need to
specify it:

```sh
# marimo is in [dependency-groups] → "notebooks" group
uv run --group notebooks marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection
```

Once you know marimo is available, use whatever CLI runner the project uses:

```sh
# uv-managed project
uv run marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection

# pixi-managed project
pixi run marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection
```

Skip `--sandbox` here — the project already manages dependencies.

If `pyproject.toml` exists but marimo is **not** in the deps, treat this as
"outside a project" (see below).

## Outside a Python project

Prefer `--sandbox`. Sandbox mode creates an isolated environment for the
notebook and writes dependencies into the script itself as inline PEP 723
metadata — so the notebook stays self-contained and reproducible.

```sh
# With uv available (preferred)
uvx marimo@latest edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection --sandbox

# With marimo installed globally
marimo edit notebook.py --no-token --no-skew-protection --sandbox
```

## Global marimo install

If marimo is installed globally, check the version — code mode shipped in
v0.20.1. If the installed version is older, prompt the user to upgrade before
proceeding.

## Nothing found

If no project marimo, no `uv`/`uvx`, and no global `marimo` on PATH, tell the
user to install `uv` (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`) or
install marimo (`pip install marimo`).
