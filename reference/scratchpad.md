# Scratchpad Reference

Recipes for executing code to inspect notebook state. Results come back to
you — the user doesn't see them.

The scratchpad is just Python. You can `print(df.head())` or run any expression
directly — the notebook's cell variables are already in scope. The preamble
below is only needed when you want to inspect kernel internals (graph structure,
cell metadata, defs/refs).

**Scoping:** Variables defined in the scratchpad do not persist between
execute-code calls. Only notebook cell variables survive. Do all dependent
work in a single call, and avoid polluting the kernel namespace.

## Contents

- [list-cells](#list-cells) — cell IDs, defs, refs, code
- [cell-status](#cell-status) — running, stale, error states
- [check-graph](#check-graph) — cycles, multiply-defined, stale cells
- [inspect-variables](#inspect-variables) — kernel globals
- [compile-check](#compile-check) — syntax + defs/refs without execution
- [dry-run](#dry-run) — register and check graph impact, then clean up

## Kernel preamble

Only needed for the recipes below that access `kernel` or `graph`:

```python
from marimo._runtime.context import get_context

kernel = get_context()._kernel
graph = kernel.graph
```

## list-cells

```python
for cid, cell in graph.cells.items():
    print(cid, cell.defs, cell.refs, cell.code[:80])
```

## cell-status

```python
for cid, cell in graph.cells.items():
    print(cid, cell._status.state, f"stale={cell._stale.state}")
```

**Don't:** Use `.state` or `.is_running` directly — status is on `._status.state`.

## check-graph

```python
graph.get_multiply_defined()   # name conflicts
graph.cycles                   # cell IDs in cycles
graph.get_stale()              # all stale cell IDs
```

## inspect-variables

```python
for name, val in kernel.globals.items():
    print(name, type(val).__name__, getattr(val, 'shape', ''))
```

## compile-check

Syntax + defs/refs validation without execution. Cheap — always do this before
creating or editing a cell. `compile_cell` does not register the cell in the
graph, so there is nothing to clean up afterward.

```python
from marimo._ast.compiler import compile_cell
from marimo._types.ids import CellId_t

cell = compile_cell(code, cell_id=CellId_t("test"))
print(f"defs={cell.defs}, refs={cell.refs}")
```

## dry-run

Register a cell in the graph to check for conflicts and cycles, then clean up.

```python
from marimo._ast.compiler import compile_cell
from marimo._types.ids import CellId_t

cell_id = CellId_t("dry_run")
cell = compile_cell(code, cell_id=cell_id)
graph.register_cell(cell_id, cell)
print(graph.get_multiply_defined(), graph.cycles)
graph.delete_cell(cell_id)  # ALWAYS clean up
```
